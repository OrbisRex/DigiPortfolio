# DiGi Portfolio (PHP & Symfony)
A project brought back to live with the plan to make it live, eventually.

Main purpose is to collect evidence of learning, allow evaluation and present the results in concise and effective manner.

## Note
This code has its cousin in Python and Django. It has been created for my learning purposes and it looks like Symfony won. ðŸ˜Ž
